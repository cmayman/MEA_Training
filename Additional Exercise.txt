Additional exercise, a bit simpler than ones in the exercise file, but also represents something important. The recombination of multiple files.

Run the following commands to create 3 files, each with a single number inside them:

echo "1" > file1.txt
echo "2" > file2.txt
echo "3" > file3.txt

Use the cat command to combine the files into a single file called file4.txt.

The resulting file should then have the contents, verify with cat file4.txt:

  
1
2
3

Once done, use rm file[1-4].txt to remove the files
